# NOT VERY WELL TESTED !! USE IT UNDER YOUR OWN RISK !!

# From an issue in docker-brew-mageia issue:
# @tianon:
# git checkout -b dist master - this is actually how I prefer to maintain my
# images now (after trying a variety of methods); essentially, you have a "master"
# branch where you never ever commit tarballs, and it holds the full history of
# all your nice scripts and scaffolding (directories and the like), and once you're
# ready to commit and push a new tarball, you create a new "dist" branch based on
# the "master" branch, and make your single tarball commit there, then force push
# that to GitHub - once it's time for the next release, you git branch -D dist
# (to delete your local "dist" branch), and then git checkout -b dist master again
# to make a brand new one that doesn't contain that older tarball commit
